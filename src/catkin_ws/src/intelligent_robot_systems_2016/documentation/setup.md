## Ready-to-deploy system

If you do not have Linux or do not want to pollute your Linux distro with extra packages, you can use the ready-to-deply OVA file located [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/go0ekx1vexm6rg1/IRS_course_2016.ova?dl=0). Username is ```manos``` and password is ```robot2016```.

Remember that the code will operate correctly but **much slower** that a real Linux installation.

Note: If the OVA file throws an error when imported deactivate the USB devices from the virtual machine manager.

## Installation - Setup

This series of challenges require the utilization of the **STDR Simulator** which is a collection of **ROS** packages. The operating system required is **Ubuntu 14.04**.

[ROS](http://www.ros.org/) is a "flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms." 

[STDR Simulator](http://stdr-simulator-ros-pkg.github.io/) is a two dimentional robot simulator that enables simple simulation of robots in an intuitive and easy way. It is based on ROS and its main goal is to enable you to setup a simulation environment in just a few minutes.

###ROS installation

First of all you must install ROS. The flavour is ROS Indigo if you have Ubuntu 14.04 installed. The installation instructions can be found here:
- [ROS Indigo installation](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu)

###Download the required packages

Note for Ubuntu 16.04: Before you start, make sure that pip (python) is installed and its version is greater than 9.01. You can install or update to the latest version with the following commands:

```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```

The required packages you have to download are STDR Simulator and the current repository. Before them install the following libraries:

```
sudo apt-get install git mercurial ros-indigo-map-server python-pip libffi-dev
(NOTE for Ubuntu 16.04 / ROS Kinetic users replace "ros-indigo-map-server" with "ros-kinetic-map-server")

sudo apt-get install gfortran libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev
sudo pip install cython
sudo pip install cffi scikit-image
sudo easy_install scipy
```

For Ubuntu 16.04 / ROS Kinetic users, you must also install:
```
sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools qt4-qmake qt4-designer
```

Create a catkin repository in a folder you want (in this tutorial we create in in $HOME):
```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
cd catkin_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
```

Next, clone the STDR Simulator:
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/stdr-simulator-ros-pkg/stdr_simulator.git
cd stdr_simulator
git checkout autonomous_systems
```

For Ubuntu 16.04 / ROS Kinetic users, you must erase the [following line](https://github.com/stdr-simulator-ros-pkg/stdr_simulator/blob/autonomous_systems/stdr_server/CMakeLists.txt#L40).

Next, clone the Intelligent Robotic System's repository:
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone https://github.com/etsardou/intelligent_robot_systems_2016.git
```

Build the packages:
```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make -j1

cd ~/catkin_ws/src/intelligent_robot_systems_2016/art_autonomous_exploration/src
make
```
If the build was successful you are ok!
