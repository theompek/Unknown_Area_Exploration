# Files and structure

The ```Intelligent Robot Systems``` repository contains three ROS packages, named ```art_autonomous_exploration```, ```art_dummy_slam``` and ```art_ogmpp```. These are: 

- ```art_dummy_slam```: Provides the SLAM algorithms, i.e. the environment's mapping. It must be noted that a dummy SLAM is executed (the computed map will always be correct and not deformed), in order for the code to be able to run in slower machines, or even VMs. The map is provided via a ROS topic.
- ```art_ogmpp```: Provides a path planning algorithm using A* and uniform decomposition PRM. The path planning can be called via a ROS service.
- ```art_autonomous_exploration```: Contains the robot controller, i.e. the Python code that controls the simulated robot. It reads the map from the ROS topic and invokes the path planning ROS service whenever needed.

The system's structure follows:
